This repository contains the tasks completed for the Cognifyz internship. The tasks are designed to demonstrate proficiency in programming concepts such as control statements, pattern generation, and user input handling.

## Task Descriptions

### 1. Puzzle or Quiz Game
- **Description**: This task involves creating a simple puzzle or quiz game that utilizes control statements (if-else, switch-case, loops, etc.). The game should interact with the user, ask questions, and provide feedback based on the user's input.
- **Implementation**: The game can include multiple-choice questions, true/false questions, or any other type of puzzle that requires the user to make decisions and provides a score or result at the end.

### 2. Pattern Generation
- **Description**: This task involves creating a program that generates various patterns such as a pyramid, inverted pyramid, triangle, and diamond. The patterns should be generated based on user input or predefined sizes.
- **Patterns Included**:
  - Pyramid
  - Inverted Pyramid
  - Triangle
  - Diamond
- **Implementation**: The program should use loops and control statements to generate and display the patterns in the console.

### 3. Temperature Converter
- **Description**: This task involves creating a temperature converter that takes input from the user and converts the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit or vice versa.
- **Formulas**:
  - Celsius to Fahrenheit: `(Celsius * 9/5) + 32`
  - Fahrenheit to Celsius: `(Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9`
- **Implementation**: The program should prompt the user to enter a temperature value and the conversion type (Celsius to Fahrenheit or Fahrenheit to Celsius) and then display the converted temperature.

## How to Run the Programs
